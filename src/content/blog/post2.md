TypeScript has become an essential tool in modern web development, particularly in large-scale applications. Let's explore why static typing matters and how TypeScript improves code quality.

## Why Static Typing?

Static typing provides several benefits:
- Early error detection
- Better IDE support
- Improved code documentation
- Safer refactoring

## Key TypeScript Features

TypeScript introduces many powerful features:

```typescript
// Interface definition
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email?: string;
}

// Type inference
const users: User[] = [];

// Generics
function getFirst<T>(array: T[]): T | undefined {
  return array[0];
}
```

## Best Practices

1. Use strict mode
2. Leverage type inference
3. Avoid using 'any'
4. Use interfaces for object shapes
